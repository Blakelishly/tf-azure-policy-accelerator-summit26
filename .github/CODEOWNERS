# CODEOWNERS file - Defines code ownership for pull request reviews
#
# TEMPLATE NOTE: Replace @OWNER with your GitHub username or team.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# EXPECTED WARNINGS: GitHub will show "Unknown owner" errors for @OWNER in
# the template repository. This is expected and intentional - the placeholder
# must be replaced after cloning. The check-placeholders.yml workflow enforces
# this replacement.
#
# After customizing, this file ensures the right people are automatically
# requested to review pull requests.

# Default owners for everything in the repo
* @OWNER

# Workflow files require maintainer review
.github/workflows/ @OWNER

# Copilot instructions require maintainer review
.github/copilot-instructions.md @OWNER
.github/instructions/ @OWNER
