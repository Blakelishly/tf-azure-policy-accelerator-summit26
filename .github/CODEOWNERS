# EXPECTED WARNINGS: GitHub will show "Unknown owner" errors for @blakelishly in
# the template repository. This is expected and intentional - the placeholder
# must be replaced after cloning. The check-placeholders.yml workflow enforces
# this replacement.
#
# After customizing, this file ensures the right people are automatically
# requested to review pull requests.

# Default owners for everything in the repo
* @blakelishly
