# CUSTOMIZE: markers below indicate actionable customization points.
# Look for `# CUSTOMIZE:` comments throughout this file.
#
# IMPORTANT: contact_links URLs MUST be absolute URLs (relative paths do not work).
# You MUST replace blakelishly/tf-azure-policy-accelerator-summit26 with your actual org/repo or links will 404.
# - GHES users: Replace github.com with your GHES host (e.g., github.company.com)
# =============================================================================

# CUSTOMIZE: Set to `true` (default) to allow users flexibility in creating issues
# without a template. Set to `false` to require template usage—useful once you have
# comprehensive templates covering all issue types and want structured data collection.
# Consider setting to false once you have comprehensive templates and want structured intake.

  # SECURITY LINK CONFIGURATION
  # =============================================================================
  # CUSTOMIZE: Update the URL below by replacing `blakelishly/tf-azure-policy-accelerator-summit26` with your org/repo name.
  #
  # IMPORTANT: Private vulnerability reporting is ONLY available for PUBLIC repositories.
  # If your repository is private:
  # - This link will NOT provide a "Report a vulnerability" option to external users
  # - You MUST provide an email contact in SECURITY.md for security reports
  # - Consider removing or commenting out this link if it would confuse reporters
  # See .github/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md for detailed guidance on private vs. public repos.
  #
  # Trade-off notes on Security link target options:
  # - Option A: /security (used here) - Broad compatibility; general entry point that
  #   usually exists. May not lead directly to submission flow if not configured.
  # - Option B: /security/advisories/new - Best UX if enabled; direct private reporting UI.
  #   Can 404 if advisories/private reporting aren't enabled (common in new repos).
  # - Option C: blob/HEAD/SECURITY.md - Always works if the file exists; communicates policy
  #   but is not a submission endpoint.
  #
  # Recommended: Keep /security as the default. After enabling private vulnerability
  # reporting in your repository (public repos only), you can optionally change to
  # /security/advisories/new.
  #
  # TO ENABLE PRIVATE VULNERABILITY REPORTING (PUBLIC REPOSITORIES ONLY):
  # 1. Go to Settings → Security → Private vulnerability reporting
  # 2. Enable the feature
  # 3. Full documentation:
  #    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/report-and-fix-vulnerabilities/configure-vulnerability-reporting/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository

    about: Report security issues privately (do not open a public issue). Private vulnerability reporting is only available for public repositories.

  # =============================================================================
  # DISCUSSIONS LINK (OPTIONAL)
  # =============================================================================
  # Trade-off notes on Discussions link:
  # - Kept commented out by default because many downstream repos don't enable Discussions.
  # - If you know most downstream repos will enable Discussions, you can uncomment by default.
  # - Enabling this redirects support questions away from issues, which improves triage.
  #
  # HOW TO ENABLE DISCUSSIONS:
  # 1. Go to your repository Settings > General > Features
  # 2. Check the "Discussions" checkbox to enable the feature
  #    See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository
  # 3. Uncomment the block below
  # 4. Replace `blakelishly/tf-azure-policy-accelerator-summit26` with your actual organization and repository name
  # 5. Test the link in the issue template chooser to verify it works
  #
  # CUSTOMIZE: Uncomment the following block if your repository uses GitHub
  # Discussions for Q&A.
  # =============================================================================
  # - name: 💬 Questions & Discussions
  #   url: https://github.com/blakelishly/tf-azure-policy-accelerator-summit26/discussions
  #   about: Ask questions and discuss ideas (not for bug reports)

  # =============================================================================
  # SUPPORT / FAQ LINK (OPTIONAL)
  # =============================================================================
  # Use this link if your repository does NOT enable GitHub Discussions but you
  # want to redirect support questions away from issues.
  #
  # ACTION ITEM: If you don't enable Discussions (see above), consider:
  # 1. Adding a "## Support" section to your README.md
  # 2. Uncommenting and updating the URL below to point to that section
  #
  # The URL assumes your README has a #support anchor. Update the URL if your
  # support section has a different anchor or is in a different location.
